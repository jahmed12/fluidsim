Fluids-2D
=========
Real-time fluid dynamics running on the GPU with the help of WebGL and [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). It is simulated with the Navier-Stokes Equations with the simplified assumption of incompressible, homogeneous fluid.

Demo

Play around with fluids [here](http://www.csc.kth.se/~mathar/fluids-2d/). Note that you will most likely have performance issues if you are running on a integrated graphics card.
